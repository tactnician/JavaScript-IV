// CODE here for your Lambda Classes

// #### Person

// * First we need a Person class. This will be our `base-class`
// * Person receives `name` `age` `location` `gender` all as props
// * Person receives `speak` as a method.
// * This method logs out a phrase `Hello my name is Fred, I am from Bedrock` where `name` and `location` are the obj

class Person {
    constructor(obj){
        this.name = obj.name,
        this.age = obj.age,
        this.location = obj.location,
        this.gender = obj.gender,
    }
    speak(){
       return `Hello my name is ${this.name}, I am from ${this.location}`;
    }

}

// -----------------------------------------------

// #### Instructor

// * Now that we have a Person as our base class, we'll build our Instructor class.
// * Instructor uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// * Instructor has the following unique props:
//   * `specialty` what the Instructor is good at i.e. 'redux'
//   * `favLanguage` i.e. 'JavaScript, Python, Elm etc.'
//   * `catchPhrase` i.e. `Don't forget the homies`
// * Instructor has the following methods:
//   * `demo` receives a `subject` string as an argument and logs out the phrase 'Today we are learning about {subject}' where subject is the param passed in.
//   * `grade` receives a `student` object and a `subject` string as arguments and logs out '{student.name} receives a perfect score on {subject}'


class Instructor extends Person {
    constructor(attrib){
        super(attrib),
        this.specialty = attrib.specialty,
        this.favLanguage = attrib.favLanguage,
        this.catchPhrase = attrib.catchPhrase,
    }
    demo(subject){
        return `Today we are learning about ${subject}`;
    }
    grade(student, subject){
        return `${student.name} receives a perfect score on ${subject}`;
    }
}


// -----------------------------------------------

// #### Student

// * Now we need some students!
// * Student uses the same attributes that have been set up by Person
// * Student has the following unique props:
//   * `previousBackground` i.e. what the Student used to do before Lambda School
//   * `className` i.e. CS132
//   * `favSubjects`. i.e. an array of the student's favorite subjects ['Html', 'CSS', 'JavaScript']
// * Student has the following methods:
//   * `listsSubjects` a method that logs out all of the student's favoriteSubjects one by one.
//   * `PRAssignment` a method that receives a subject as an argument and logs out that the `student.name has submitted a PR for {subject}`
//   * `sprintChallenge` similar to PRAssignment but logs out `student.name has begun sprint challenge on {subject}`

class Student extends Person{
    constructor(attribs){
        this.previousBackground = attribs.previousBackground,
        this.className  = attribs.className,
        this.favSubjects = attribs.favSubjects,
    }
    listsSubjects(arr){
        return arr.forEach
    }
}

// -----------------------------------------------

// #### Project Mananger

// * Now that we have instructors and students, we'd be nowhere without our PM's
// * ProjectManagers are extensions of Instructors
// * ProjectManagers have the following uniqe props:
//   * `gradClassName`: i.e. CS1
//   * `favInstructor`: i.e. Sean
// * ProjectManangers have the following Methods:
//   * `standUp` a method that takes in a slack channel and logs `{name} announces to {channel}, @channel standy times!​​​​​
//   * `debugsCode` a method that takes in a student object and a subject and logs out `{name} debugs {student.name}'s code on {subject}`

// -----------------------------------------------
